Thus run the German title (and its English translation) of the Musical Dice Game (MDG) invented by Gustav Gerlach.  Rightly and interestingly so, as the Rules provided in the published work allow a non-professional musician to generate (``compose") nearly three (3) trillions of unique MDG Scottish Dances (SDs).  More precisely, the rules of the {\it Schottische Taenze}, as we would refer to this MDG from here onward, yields $6^{8} \times 6^{8} = 2,\!821,\!109,\!907,\!456$ unique SDs (see explanation in Subsection~\ref{tabFind}).\\  % Total: (9^6)^2 = 282,429,536,481

A {\it Musikalisches W\"{u}rfelspiel} (German for ``musical dice game" or MDG) is a system for randomly ``generating" (e.g., by using a die or two dice) musical compositions from precomposed options and was quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century.  The earliest known MDG is Johann Philipp Kirnberger's {\em Der allezeit fertige Polonoisen- und Menuettencomponist (1st ed.\ 1757; rev.\ 2nd ed.\ 1783)} (translated from German as ``The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer").  Other well-known composers that are to known to have composed a MDG are C.P.E.\ Bach ({\em Einfall, einen doppelten Contrapunct in der Octave von sechs Tacten zu machen, ohne die Regeln davon zu wissen (1758)}; translated from German as ``A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules"), Abb\'{e} Maximillian Stadler ({\em Table pour composer des minuets et des Trios \`{a} la infinie; avec deux dez \`{a} jouer (1780)}; translated from French as ``A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice"), the latter MDG being also attributed to Franz Joseph Haydn. \\

Probably the most famous of MDGs is {\it Musikalisches W\"{u}rfelspiel K. 516f (1787)}.  This MDG was first published by J.J. Hummel in 1793 in Berlin and was republished in 1796 by Nikolaus Simrock in Bonn (as K. 294d or K. Anh. C 30.01). Simrock attributed this work to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is also known under the title of {\em Anleitung zum Componieren von Walzern so viele man will vermittelst zweier W\"{u}rfel, ohne etwas von der Musik oder Composition zu verstehen} (German for ``Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition") and may have been based on Mozart's manuscript {\em K.\ 516f}, written in 1787, consisting of numerous two-bar fragments of music, that appear to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions nor hints as to the use of dice.  An \href{(http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/\~rb5h-ngc/e/k516f.htm}{online article} by Hideo Noguchi offers a possible explanation for this attribution. \\

This book is a collection of 20 MDG Scottish Dances that were generated according to the rules given in {\it Schottische Taenze}. The scores of the generated SDs, that were initially written using the \texttt{abc} environment of Chris Walshaw, were converted to Scalar Vector Graphics (SVG) images (with corresponding MIDIs) using {\tt abcm2ps} and {\tt abcmidi}, and were then pre-processed with Inkscape to be included in \LaTeX\ to produce this book.


\section{\em Schottische Taenze}

\subsection{Rules}\label{mdgRules}

The Rules provided in {\em Schottische Taenze} generate SDs consisting of exactly 32 bars (or mesaures) that are divided equally into two (2) main parts: a Dance and a Trio.  The two sets of eight (8) bars for each of the two main parts are played with repeats.  After the Trio is played, the 16 bars of the Dance are again played without repeats, yielding a total of 80 bars of music played for each MDG SD. \\

The following Rules may be followed for generating each SD (not exactly the same as given in the {\it Schottische Taenze}):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [1.] For each main part (Dance or Trio), toss a usual six-sided die eight times then obtain the numbers on the face that comes up on each toss.  Hence, 16 six-sided one-die tosses (with possible outcomes from the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} for each toss) are needed to generate a SD. (Two or four six-sided dice may also be used, what is essential is that eight (8) random integers (chosen from 1-6) are generated for constructing the 16 bars of the Dance part; ditto, for the Trio part.)
	\item [2.\label{step2}] The 16 bars for the Dance part are obtained based on the first eight (8) 1-die tosses from Step~1.  The outcome of the first 1-die toss is used for determining the notes for the first two (2) bars of the Dance based on the Table for Measure Numbers (Table~\ref{tabFind}) corresponding to this particular toss and the notes for these two bar numbers given in the Table for Measures (Table~\ref{tabMeas}).\\
	For example, suppose the first 1-die toss (for the Dance part) comes up a 2. The  Table for Measure Numbers (see Table~\ref{tabFind}) leads us to use bar {\tt 77} and bar {\tt 109} from the Table for Measures (Table~\ref{tabMeas}) for creating the 1st and 2nd bars, respectively, of this Dance part.  Thus, the G-clef notes and F-clef notes for the first bar of this Dance part being that is being constructed are: {\tt [Ec][Ec] [Fd][Ge]; C,C [B,C][\_B,C]} (in {\tt abc} notation), while those for the second bar of this Dance part that is being constructed are: {\tt !turn!f3/g/a2 \& A4; C4 \& A,3/G,/ F,2}. 

	\item[3.\label{step3}] Step~2.\ is repeated for the outcomes of the remaining seven (7) 1-die tosses from Step 1., eventually leading to the completion of the 16 bars of the Dance part. Thus, the outcome of the second 1-die toss from Step~1.\ is used for determining the notes for the 3rd and 4th bars of this Dance part that is being constructed, that of the 3rd 1-die toss for the 5th and 6th bars, and so forth, until the outcome of the 8th 1-die toss, which is used for determining the notes for the 15th and 16th bars of this Dance part that is being constructed. 
	
	\item[4.] The remaining eight (8) tosses of the 16 tosses from Step~1.\ are similarly used to find the notes for the 16 bars of the second main part (the Trio) in a manner similar to that described in Steps~2.\ and 3.\ above for the first main part (the Dance).
\end{enumerate}   

\subsection{Table for finding Measure Number from Table of Measure Numbers}\label{tabFind}
The table given here (Table~\ref{fig:0tab1}) combines the two (2) tables given on page 3 of {\it Schottische Taenze}.  The leftmost column contains the possible die outcomes (which are precisely the integers from 1 to 6 as we are tossing an ordinary six-sided die) while the topmost row contains the bar numbers (16 + 16 = 32 in all) for the MDG SD (Dance with Trio) to be generated---16 bars for the first main part (Dance) and also 16 bars for the second main part (Trio).\\

The body of Table~\ref{fig:0tab1}(a) and (b) includes $\underbrace{6 \times 16}_{\tt Dance} \;+\;$ $\underbrace{6\times 16}_{\tt Trio} \;=\;$ $6\times 32 \;=\; 192$ measure numbers, which is also the total number of measures that appear in the Table of Measures for the Dances and Trios (Figures~\ref{fig:meas1} to \ref{fig:meas4}).  Since eight (8) one-die tosses determine a unique sequence of 16 bars for a Dance part and each 1-die toss has exactly six (6) possible outcomes, then the total number of 16-bar Dance parts that can be constructed based on the Rules in Section~\ref{mdgRules} is $6^{8} = 1,679,616$ (approximately 1.68 million). Similarly, the total number of 16-bar Trio parts that can be constructed based on the Rules in Section~\ref{mdgRules} is $6^{8} = 1,679,616$.  Thus, the total number of unique MDG SDs based on {\em Schottische Taenze} is $6^{8} \times 6^{8} = 2,\!821,\!109,\!907,\!456$ (nearly 3 trillions). \\
